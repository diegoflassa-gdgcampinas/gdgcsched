=====================================================================================================================================

[GDG-Campinas](www.gdg-campinas.org) is a Google Developer Group based on the city of Campinas, SÃ£o Paulo.

This project is the Android app for its conferences. The app supports devices
running Android 5.0+, and is optimized for phones and tablets of all shapes
and sizes.

<h2>Source</h2>

The source code in [this repository](https://github.com/gdg-campinas/treffen) is a customization from a fork of the [I/O Sched](https://github.com/google/iosched) app.

<h2>Features</h2>

With the app, you can:

  * View the conference agenda and edit your personal schedule
  * Sync your schedule between all of your devices and the Conference website
  * View detailed session, code lab, office hours, and speaker information,
    including speaker bios, photos, and Google+ profiles
  * Participate in public conversations on Google+, and use the conference-specific hashtag.
  * Guide yourself using the vector-based conference map
  * Get a reminder a few minutes before sessions in your schedule are due to
    start
  * Play Live session video streams
  * Send feedback on sessions, from your phone/tablet.

<h2>How to Work with the Source</h2>

We recommend the use of the original [I/O Sched](https://github.com/google/iosched) source as a reference or start point for your own app.<br>
